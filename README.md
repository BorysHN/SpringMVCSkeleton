### Notes 
> Despite having access to various references to spring mvc I still had some
issues putting together all the components for a running application on tomcat.
Between various configuration conflicts, outdated information, and a few
environment hiccups using the latest technologies, it was a nice learning
expereience. Big thanks to a few blogs out there that really helped.
